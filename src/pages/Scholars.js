          I'm John Roy Daradal and I’m a fourth year BS Computer Science student
          in the University of the Philippines Visayas. I’m from Bohol where my
          mother works as a teacher. I have a brother who is in his senior year
          in high school. My mother and father separated when I was just three
          and my brother was a week old. We never heard or got any support from
          my father after he left. We were raised by my grandmother, who is now
          a retired school teacher. I graduated Valedictorian in Jagna Central
          Elementary School. For my first two years in high school, I studied in
          Central Visayan Institute Foundation, also in my town Jagna, where I
          received a full scholarship for my academic performance. But during my
          junior year, my mother took me and my brother to Tagbilaran City
          because she was hired as an elementary teacher in Bohol Wisdom School,
          our province’s most prestigious school. It was a dilemma for my part
          that time since I was torn between staying in Jagna and enjoy my
          scholarship and studying in the city where my tuition would be
          deducted from my mother’s salary. I chose the latter. My mother
          assured me that she would make both ends meet just so the three of us
          could be together. She gave tutorial sessions to augment her meager
          salary. Being the new kid in school, I never expected to excel in
          academics, but I did. I graduated Salutatorian and made my family
          really proud.

          I only took two college entrance exams: the UPCAT and the entrance
          exam for  University of San Carlos in Cebu.During the application for
          UPCAT, I haven’t made up my mind what to take in college. So just so I
          can place a course in my application, I wrote BS Computer Science.
          During that time, I was enjoying our computer classes and lessons in
          programming so I thought it would be ok if I chose Computer Science.
          Another confusion I had was what campus to choose. Diliman was too far
          and Cebu was too near. So I settled for the one in the middle:
          Iloilo.When the UPCAT results were released, I was very pleased to
          know that I passed. But after graduation, I only received the letter
          from San Carlos but none from UP. So I decided maybe UP was not for
          me. My mom already contacted someone in Cebu for my boarding house.She
          also prepared for our trip to Cebu for my enrolment. But a week before
          the confirmation of slots was due, I received the letter. It turned
          out the letter had been wrongly addressed to Jagna, Iloilo instead of
          Jagna, Bohol. That letter changed everything. The next day we
          immediately went to Iloilo and confirmed my slot. My mom was really
          pleased with the big tuition difference of UP and USC that she
          immediately said I would be studying here instead of in Cebu.

          I applied for the STFAP scholarship and I got into Bracket D(P200 /
          unit). Since my  mother is the only one supporting us, we only have
          enough money for our basic needs. But in college, there are always
          other fees to be paid. Organization and dorm fees and shirts are some
          of these. Since that is not in my mother’s budget, I always found
          myself paying days after the deadline because I really didn’t have
          money. Other times I would take the money from my allowance and it’s
          my health and nutrition that would suffer. I was surprised one day in
          my junior year when I was called to the STFAP Office. Ma'am Celine
          told me to take a scholarship from the UP Silak-Silab Foundation
          because I qualified for their grant. I was so happy to hear this and
          so was my mom when I told her because finally I would have some
          financial aid besides hers. I really felt happy that I could help her
          now in the financial matters because I didn't have to ask her for
          money every time I have some emergency fees to pay. Now that I didn’t
          have to worry always about money, I gained some weight and improved on
          my academic work. I became University Scholar for three consecutive
          semesters starting junior year; an improvement to my two College
          Scholar achievements during my first two years.

          During my four years of stay in college, I kept myself busy in school
          work. Some of my achievements include winning the first place in
          Komsai.org’s Codefest 2010, which is a programming contest for all
          Computer Science students in UPV. But what I pride myself in is the
          quality of the work that I do. During our junior year, our adviser
          picked the best students in our batch to be sent to do our OJT in
          Kabalaka Foundation in Iloilo City. My adviser picked me first and I
          was assigned to be the leader. The people working at Kabalaka
          Foundation were impressed at our team because we finished six systems
          for them in one month. Currently, I am leading a web game development
          team.

          Besides being busy with school work, I also have something else that
          always gets me busy. When I was a sophomore, I joined the UPV Hublag
          Dance Company. I wasn’t really into serious dancing during high
          school. I knew I could dance but I didn’t really care before.Joining
          Hublag Dance Company was a result of a self - challenge. I dared
          myself to do something else besides academics for a change. Back in
          high school, during the deliberation of honor students for graduation,
          I was told by my teacher that I was the top student when it came to
          academics. The only thing that pulled my rank down was my extra -
          curricular activities. So I guess that frustration also played a part
          of my joining. I continually improved myself in dancing and eventually
          our adviser and choreographer trusted me enough to give me dances to
          choreograph. My family was surprised when they learned that I was in a
          dance company since I didn’t really show that much inclination in
          dancing before. This year, I was elected as the dance company
          president. This exposure to being the org president gave me experience
          in managing people and leadership. Currently, we are busy preparing
          for our dance concert on February 22 entitled ICONOPOP which will
          feature dances from the 4 top icons of all time: Madonna, Beyonce,
          Celine Dion and Michael Jackson. I have two choreographic works in
          this concert.

          Now, I’ve been thinking about life after graduation. I am planning to
          work here in the  Philippines for a few years to gain experience, and
          when I’m already satisfied and really good at what I do, maybe I can
          move on to a bigger company where I can share my talent and knowledge
          to benefit the people. Another option is to take the teaching career
          path. It runs in our family(my grandmother, mother and four aunts are
          teachers) and I find joy in helping others understand something
          better. I was brought up with the value of helping others always
          instilled in my mind. This I guess is something the UP Silak - Silab
          Foundation and I have in common: the value of helping others in need.

          On April, I'd soon be graduating and I’m a candidate for graduating
          with honors (cum laude). And I would really like to thank UP
          Silak-Silab Foundation for being part of my journey through college.
          The last two years of help from the Foundation really made it a smooth
          sail for me. I didn't have to think of financial problems anymore
          since I always had something saved from my stipend. Now, I have saved
          most of my stipend so I can have some money after I graduate college
          and start looking for work. My mom promised me she'll continue my
          allowance until I get a job but still I'd like her to spend it on
          herself or for my brother who's also going to be in college next year,
          in a seminary in Baguio, and spend my savings instead. I'm really
          thankful for UP Silak - Silab Foundation's generosity and their vision
          of helping needy students. I've been told that next year after we
          graduate, a new batch of students will be given the grant. This makes
          me happy also because I know how much joy this also gives the other
          students.I've been in their shoes before. More power to you UP
          Silak-Silab Foundation and may you continue to give deserving students
          the help that you have extended to me."
