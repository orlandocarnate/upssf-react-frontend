                Board members will be elected from those nominated by
                voting-members. A candidate should be a voting-member to be
                eligible. Nomination may be submitted by the candidate or by
                others on the candidate's behalf via e-mail. However, the
                nomination should be accepted by the candidate via e-mail or
                phone. A list containing the names of all candidates nominated
                will be posted in the SILAK-SILAB Foundation's website and
                e-mailed to the e-groups.Â Each voting-member may cast a vote for
                up to 5 candidates by sending an e-mail to the designated e-mail
                address below. A voting-member can cast only one vote for each
                candidate.
              </p>
              <p>
                Election will be by plurality vote. The five candidates with the
                highest vote total will be elected to the Board. The first three
                candidates with the highest vote total will serve a term of two
                years while the next two candidates will serve a term of one
                year in accordance with Section 5.02(B) of the U.P. SILAK-SILAB
                Foundation's By-Laws.
