          Welcome to the University of the Philippines SILAK-SILAB Foundation, a
          non-profit, tax-exempt Section 501(c)(3) public charity organization
          incorporated in Illinois, USA. It believes in the value of education
          and is dedicated to improving the lives of disadvantaged young
          individuals by providing educational assistance such as scholarships,
          tuition assistance, and stipends, for qualified students.
        </p>

          The Foundation’s mission is to liberate poor but deserving students
          from poverty through access to education.

        <p>
          Membership to the Foundation is open to all members of the U.P. SILAK
          Brotherhood and UP SILAB Sisterhood. The members of the Foundation are
          united in their desire to contribute in their own little way to their
          country and their alma mater.
        </p>

        <p>
          The members of the Foundation declare their belief in the following
          shared values:
          <ul>
            <li>Personal and professional integrity</li>
            <li>Mutual respect with all Foundation members</li>
            <li>Transparency in governance</li>
            <li>Adherence to democratic processes</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          At present, the Foundation offers scholarship grants to deserving
          college students in the University of the Philippines in the Visayas –
          Iloilo Campus. To qualify, the college student should come from the
          low-income bracket and should have good grades and should maintain a
          predetermined average grade to renew the grant.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2008, the Foundation, through its members and their friends, raised
          fund to assist the victims of Typhoon Frank that devastated millions
          of homes and properties and left millions of people without shelter in
          Iloilo City, Philippines. As the Foundation undertakes more fund
          raising activities, more projects will be initiated.
