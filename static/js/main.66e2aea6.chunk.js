For my first two years in high school, I studied in Central Visayan Institute Foundation, also in my town Jagna, where I received a full scholarship for my academic performance. But during my junior year, my mother took me and my brother to Tagbilaran City because she was hired as an elementary teacher in Bohol Wisdom School, our province\u2019s most prestigious school. It was a dilemma for my part that time since I was torn between staying in Jagna and enjoy my scholarship and studying in the city where my tuition would be deducted from my mother\u2019s salary. I chose the latter. My mother assured me that she would make both ends meet just so the three of us could be together. She gave tutorial sessions to augment her meager salary.
