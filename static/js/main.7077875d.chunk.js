We never heard or got any support from my father after he left. We were raised by my grandmother, who is now a retired school teacher. I graduated Valedictorian in Jagna Central Elementary School. For my first two years in high school, I studied in Central Visayan Institute Foundation, also in my town Jagna, where I received a full scholarship for my academic performance. But during my junior year, my mother took me and my brother to Tagbilaran City because she was hired as an elementary teacher in Bohol Wisdom School, our province\u2019s most prestigious school. It was a dilemma for my part that time since I was torn between staying in Jagna and enjoy my scholarship and studying in the city where my tuition would be deducted from my mother\u2019s salary. I chose the latter. My mother assured me that she would make both ends meet just so the three of us could be together. She gave tutorial sessions to augment her meager salary.

During that time, I was enjoying our computer classes and lessons in programming so I thought it would be ok if I chose Computer Science. Another confusion I had was what campus to choose. Diliman was too far and Cebu was too near. So I settled for the one in the middle: Iloilo.When the UPCAT results were released, I was very pleased to know that I passed. But after graduation, I only received the letter from San Carlos but none from UP. So I decided maybe UP was not for me. My mom already contacted someone in Cebu for my boarding house.She also prepared for our trip to Cebu for my enrolment. But a week before the confirmation of slots was due, I received the letter. It turned out the letter had been wrongly addressed to Jagna, Iloilo instead of Jagna, Bohol. That letter changed everything. The next day we immediately went to Iloilo and confirmed my slot.

Other times I would take the money from my allowance and it\u2019s my health and nutrition that would suffer. I was surprised one day in my junior year when I was called to the STFAP Office. Ma'am Celine told me to take a scholarship from the UP Silak-Silab Foundation because I qualified for their grant. I was so happy to hear this and so was my mom when I told her because finally I would have some financial aid besides hers. I really felt happy that I could help her now in the financial matters because I didn't have to ask her for money every time I have some emergency fees to pay.

Back in high school, during the deliberation of honor students for graduation, I was told by my teacher that I was the top student when it came to academics. The only thing that pulled my rank down was my extra - curricular activities. So I guess that frustration also played a part of my joining. I continually improved myself in dancing and eventually our adviser and choreographer trusted me enough to give me dances to choreograph. My family was surprised when they learned that I was in a dance company since I didn\u2019t really show that much inclination in dancing before. This year, I was elected as the dance company president. This exposure to being the org president gave me experience in managing people and leadership.
